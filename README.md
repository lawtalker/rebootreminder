# rebootreminder
This is an xbar plugin that displays uptime in days. The display is in gray, getting darker over time, 
and after a configurable number of days (default 7) the display is in red. The point of the plugin is 
to remind the user to consider rebooting.

The plugin draws its inspiration from the uptime plugin by Matteo Ferrando.
